## About the Book
Honeypots are like digital traps designed to lure malicious attackers away from your real systems. Imagine setting up a fake store to attract thieves while your real store is safe and hidden. Honeypots work in a similar way, drawing the attention of cybercriminals and allowing you to study their tactics and potentially prevent future attacks.

This book simplifies the concept of honeypots, which are important tools in cybersecurity. The book explains their history, types, and how to design and use them effectively. It includes practical advice on setting up honeypots, monitoring them, and analyzing attacks. It also offers strategies for blue team professionals, like SOC analysts, to improve defenses and serves as a helpful resource for purple team members to practice detecting attacks. Additionally, it discusses how honeypots contribute to threat intelligence and cybersecurity training, including new ideas like quantum honeypots, preparing professionals to face modern cyber threats.

By the end of this book, you will be able to effectively deploy and manage honeypots, analyze attack data, and implement strategies to protect your organization from malicious attacks.
